# Front-end Developer Exercise #

Build a fully responsive single webpage based on comp at https://invis.io/RHB9XQT4A


### Requirements ###

* Build static HTML page using SCSS/CSS and JS and commit


### Success Criteria ###

* The markup should be semantic and accessible.
* The page should be presentable in all modern browsers as well as IE 9+, though not necessarily visually identical across the board. Please document intentional deviations.
* You should not create a mobile/responsive version, as we will not be giving any credit for it.
* The page should be usable without JavaScript, though not necessarily functionally identical (e.g. the Dynamic Content user story requires JavaScript). Please document intentional deviations.
* You should not use a single-page application framework (e.g. Angular, Ember, React), though you can use any other libraries that you need (e.g. jQuery, Lodash, etc.).

### Resources ###

The visual design team has provided several deliverables to help with construction of the page:

* a mockup of what the finished product should look like: ./resources/mockup.jpg
* an annotated mockup for more detailed information on fonts/measurements/etc: ./resources/annotated-mockup.jpg.
* an example of a possible transition for the navigation menu: ./resources/transition-example.gif.
* All of the copy can be found at ./resources/body-copy.txt.

* Any image you need can be found in the ./app/assets/images directory. Some images have been sliced in multiple ways, so use whichever you feel make the most sense to use, or not at all if you feel you don't need to.

* Comps are built in Sketch - download comps
* Assets - download assets
